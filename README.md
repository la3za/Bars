# Bars
Implement 10 different progressbars or bargraphs on Arduino using customized LCD character sets.
 
Design principle: Custom character set should be uploaded just once for each bar, thus excluding bars that require more or less continuous updates of character sets during progression of the bar. This is excluded due to the potential wearing out of the LCD character memory.

Bars can start and stop on user-selectable columns.
