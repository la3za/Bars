# Bars
Implements a number of different progressbars or bargraphs on Arduino using customized LCD character sets. Bars can start and stop on user-selectable columns. 
 
Design principle: Custom character set should be uploaded just once for each bar, thus excluding fancier bars that require more or less continuous updates of character sets during progression of the bar. This is excluded due to the potential wearing out of the LCD character memory.
